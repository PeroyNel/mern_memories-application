# MERN Memories Application
 
This application allows users to log in via Email or Google and then to create, edit, like or remove posts from their catalogue. The Front End was done with React and Material-UI. The Back End was built with Node.JS, Express, Axios and MongoDB. The app relies on using Redux and Reducers to handle state management, aided by Thunk to manage the middleware.
