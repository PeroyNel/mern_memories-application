# MERN Memories Application

https://mern-memories-full-application.netlify.app/posts

This application allows users to log in via Email or Google and then to create, edit, like or remove posts from their catalogue. The Front End was done with React and Material-UI. The Back End was built with Node.JS, Express, Axios and MongoDB. The app relies on using Redux and Reducers to handle state management, aided by Thunk to manage the middleware.

How To Use This Repository:

After downloading the application file open it in VS Studio Code, open two independent Terminals to issue the following commands "cd server" and for the second terminal "cd client".
Following this you can use the command "npm i" for both the client and server.
Once the install is complete use "npm start" on both the client and server for the application to start. You can now find it at the url localhost:3000 in your browser.
